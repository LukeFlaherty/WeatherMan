### An example of a PWA web app which stands for Progressive Web App.
- The PWA, or a progressive web app, is basically a web app that is able to be accessed through its own native icon rather than opening a URL in your browser. So then, what’s a web app? It’s an application built on technologies run on your web browser. Unlike what’s expected from static websites, web apps and thus PWAs are able to have highly interactive and complex user interfaces like what’s expected from your regular desktop or mobile app. Much of the processing is done on a remote server which is now more viable than ever with highly reliable and cost-effective shared cloud hosting.

- I became familliar with Service Workers as it was a big part of this project, feel free to take a look at the code and see just how they were used.
- Through their use and the use of cache I am able to make the page load quicker everytime you visit as it will store information so that you need not reload the page each time you visit
- Service worker makes sure that page respons with 200 when offline
